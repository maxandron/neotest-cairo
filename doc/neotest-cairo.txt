1. neotest-cairo                                 *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo*

Neotest adapter for running Cairo tests in Neovim.


WIP                                          *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-wip*

Although the adapter works, it is still early in development and may have some
rough edges.

For instance:

- I didn’t test it on Windows (though I did take Windows into account when writing the code)
- Only tested on snforge 0.19.0
    - I expect output to change slightly between version in which case we will need to add support for multiple versions

Also - see TODO.md for a list of things that may need to be done.


FEATURES                                *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-features*

- Supports passing, failing, and ignored tests.
- Supports running from all positions (test, module, file, directory).
- Finds test outside the current working directory.
- Inline diagnostics.
- Supports tests combined with sources.
- Finds tests in both src and tests directories.


REQUIREMENTS                        *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-requirements*

- Neovim >= 0.10.0
    - Probably works on older versions, but not tested yet.
- **Starknet Foundry** - for snforge
- Neotest <https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest> as this is an adapter for it.
    - and the rest of Neotest’s dependencies (nio, plenary, FixCursorHold)
- nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/> with the `cairo` parser installed.


INSTALLATION                        *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-installation*

Install the plugin with your favorite package manager.


LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    {
      "nvim-neotest/neotest",
      dependencies = {
        "nvim-neotest/nvim-nio",
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "antoinemadec/FixCursorHold.nvim",
        "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
        -- This is where you install the adapter:

      },
      opts = function()
        return {
          adapters = {
            -- This is where you add the adapter:
            require("neotest-cairo"),
          },
          -- The rest of your Neotest configuration

TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING    *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-tips-&-troubleshooting*


ISSUES WITH SETTING UP OR USING THE ADAPTER ~

You can run `:checkhealth neotest-cairo` to review common issues. If you need
help, please open a discussion here
<https://github.com/maxandron/neotest-cairo/discussions/new?category=q-a>.

You can also enable logging to further inspect what’s going on under the
hood. Neotest-cairo piggybacks on the Neotest logger. You can enable it like
so:

>lua
    require("neotest.logging"):set_level(vim.log.levels.INFO)
<

Please note that this could cause tests to run slower, so don’t forget to
remove this setting once you have resolved your issue!

Lower the log level further to `DEBUG` to get even more information. The lowest
level is `TRACE`, but is not used by this adapter and is only useful when
debugging issues with Neotest.

You can get ahold of the log file’s path using
`require("neotest.logging"):get_filename()`, which usually points to your
`~/.local/state/nvim/neotest.log`.

The logfile tends to be ginormous and if you are only looking for neotest-cairo
related entries, you can search for the `[neotest-cairo]` prefix.


SHOUTOUT                                *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-shoutout*

neotest-cairo is heavily inspired by neotest-golang
<https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/neotest-golang>.

Having it as a reference made it much easier to write this adapter. The code is
clean and well documented.

Thank you!
