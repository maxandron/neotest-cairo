1. neotest-cairo                                 *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo*

Neotest adapter for running Cairo tests in Neovim.


WIP                                          *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-wip*

Although the adapter works, it is still early in development and may have some
rough edges.

For instance:

- I didn’t test it on Windows (though I did take Windows into account when writing the code)
- Only tested on snforge 0.19.0
    - I expect output to change slightly between version in which case we will need to add support for multiple versions

Also - see TODO.md for a list of things that may need to be done.


FEATURES                                *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-features*

- Supports passing, failing, and ignored tests.
- Supports running from all positions (test, module, file, directory).
- Finds test outside the current working directory.
- Inline diagnostics.
- Supports tests combined with sources.
- Finds tests in both src and tests directories.


REQUIREMENTS                        *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-requirements*

- Neovim >= 0.10.0
    - Probably works on older versions, but not tested yet.
- **Starknet Foundry** - for snforge
- Neotest <https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest> as this is an adapter for it.
    - and the rest of Neotest’s dependencies (nio, plenary, FixCursorHold)
- nvim-treesitter <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/> with the `cairo` parser installed.

SHOUTOUT                                *neotest-cairo-neotest-cairo-shoutout*

neotest-cairo is heavily inspired by neotest-golang
<https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/neotest-golang>.

Having it as a reference made it much easier to write this adapter.
